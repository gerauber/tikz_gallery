# TikZ Gallery

A gallery of my vector drawings using the TikZ package in Latex


## Content

This repository contains a project intended to catalogue some of my drawing that I did throughout my academic journey. 

As it is written in PHP, one would have to launch a local server in order to access the two different categories of drawings:
one dedicated to simple, yet instructive drawings about physics, and the other fully dedicated to Feynman diagrams.

The result can also be consulted on my [website](https://syntaxerror.ch/)
